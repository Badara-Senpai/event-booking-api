# Event Booking API

This project is an Event Booking API built with Go. It provides functionality for CRUD operations on events, user authentication, and user registration for events. The project uses Gin for the HTTP web framework, JWT for JSON Web Tokens, and SQLite for the database.
Will add soon a frontend app in NextJS to combine it with this api. ðŸ¤ž

## Features

- **CRUD Operations for Events**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete events.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT.
- **User Registration for Events**: Users can register for events.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: Programming language.
- **Gin**: HTTP web framework.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storage.
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing.
